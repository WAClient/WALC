To download the pre-built AppImage, go to the [Latest Release](https://github.com/WAClient/WALC/releases/latest) page

## Installing WALC - Prebuilt AppImage 
* Download the latest AppImage in ~/.local/bin which is a recommended location for AppImages
* Make it executable using `chmod +x ~/.local/bin/WALC.AppImage`

## Installing WALC - AUR
```bash
# Using 'yay'

yay -S walc

# Using 'pamac'

pamac install walc
```

## Manual Compilation and Usage

If you want to compile the code from its source (applies to the AUR version), you will need the following dependencies:

- `nodejs` **<= v16** - later versions such as (17 and 18) crash in the install process, this version is an LTS (called `nodejs-lts-gallium`)
- `npm`
- `git` (you **do not need** `git` when installing WALC form the AUR)

After that you must:

```bash

# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/WAClient/WALC.git

# Move to WALC directory
cd WALC

# Install the dependencies
npm install

# Build the assets
npm run dev

# Or alternatively to watch for changes
npm run watch

# And to start the app
npm start
```
